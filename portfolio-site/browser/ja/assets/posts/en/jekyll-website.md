## Overview

This website was created using **Jekyll**, a static site generator that enables quick and efficient blog or website development with just HTML and CSS.

For the frontend, I use **Bootstrap**, which provides responsive design features ensuring good compatibility across mobile and desktop devices. Bootstrap‚Äôs components such as navigation bars and jumbotrons add polished UI elements effortlessly.

**Font Awesome** is integrated for social media icons in the navigation bar, enhancing the site's visual appeal.

Custom CSS is organized using **SASS**, which helps keep styles modular and maintainable.

To support bilingual content, I created a Japanese version of the site by duplicating each English page with a corresponding reference ID. Using a small script in Jekyll‚Äôs **Liquid** templating language, the site dynamically pairs each English page with its Japanese translation, allowing users to switch languages via the navigation bar.

The source code for this website is available on my GitHub.
