## Overview

**Voice Gengo** is a full-stack web application designed to help language learners improve their speaking skills. The platform supports both **English** and **Japanese**, and offers interactive tools for practicing and sharing language content.

Users can:
- Create language-focused posts and digital notebooks
- Record themselves speaking their target language
- Share recordings, posts, or notes with native speakers
- Receive feedback from the community

While all core features were available for free, premium options were also included, such as:
- Scheduling 1-on-1 lessons with tutors
- Submitting voice recordings or notebook entries for professional corrections

Despite its potential, the platform didn’t gain much traction—possibly due to its niche focus or limited marketing reach. Nevertheless, developing Voice Gengo end-to-end was an invaluable experience. I implemented both frontend and backend, adhered to **OWASP security best practices**, and deployed the application on **Google Cloud Compute**.

Although VoiceGengo.com is no longer live due to low traffic, the project remains a highlight of my portfolio for its scope, technical depth, and educational value.
