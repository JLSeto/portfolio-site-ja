# Website Refresh: 2025 Edition ðŸš€  
**Date:** July 11, 2025  
**Tech Stack:** TypeScript, Angular, GitHub Pages

This past week, I rebuilt my website using the latest Angular. The goal was to modernize the design, simplify the structure, and take advantage of new features for better performance and easier maintenance.

## How ChatGPT Helped

ChatGPT was a huge time saver. Instead of spending hours digging through documentation and forums, I could just ask questions and get clear, relevant answers with code snippets. It helped me stay focused on coding rather than getting bogged down searching for solutions.

## Where It Fell Short

That said, ChatGPT isnâ€™t perfect. Sometimes its suggestions were too generic or missed details specific to my setup. For example, when I asked about rendering Markdown in Angular, it recommended importing a large library that added over 1MB to my build â€” which wasnâ€™t ideal. I had to be careful and double-check what it suggested, especially when it came to performance impacts.

## Takeaways

Itâ€™s impressive how much my productivity improved with AI assistance. Combining AI tools with official documentation made what could have been a multi-day project possible in less than a week. The technology still makes assumptions and sometimes requires explicit instructions, but the time saved is well worth the occasional hiccup. As AI coding assistants continue to evolve, I expect productivity gains will only get better.

The new site is faster, cleaner, and easier to maintain. Iâ€™m excited to keep iterating and adding new content.
